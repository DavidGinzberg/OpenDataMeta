OpenDataMeta
============

A resource dedicated to listing data about as many open data sets as possible

This project is intended to serve as a single location to gather links to open data portals for entities such as City, National, Local, and other sources of machine-readable data. Initially it will start as just a list of links but hopefully as it grows it will also include inforamtion about the data sources such as how many data sets they contain, the scope/context of those data sets, any licensing issues associated with the data sets, and other relevant, useful, or intersting data about the data source or the entity/entities that maintain it.

Example Data portals:
